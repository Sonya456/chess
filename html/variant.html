          <p>There are more than two thousand published chess variants, most of them of relatively recent origin, including:

               <br>1) Direct predecessors of chess such as chaturanga and shatranj.<br>
               <br>2) Traditional national or regional games that share common ancestors with Western chess such as xiangqi, shogi, janggi, makruk, and sittuyin.
               <br>3)Modern variations employing different rules (e.g. Losing chess), different forces (e.g. Dunsany's Chess), non-standard pieces (e.g. Grand Chess), or different board geometries (e.g. hexagonal chess). One rules variant that has gained significantly in popularity is Chess960 (named "Fischerandom" by its inventor). In Chess960, the starting position is selected randomly from 960 unique possibilities, including the classic chess initial position without change, while the other 959 render the use of prepared opening lines impracticable. In 2008, FIDE added Chess960 to its Handbook.
               <br>4)Infinite chess, which has drawn the attention of mathematicians.
                
               <br> <br> Prime sources in English describing chess variants and their rules include David Pritchard's encyclopedias,[150] the website The Chess Variant Pages created by Hans Bodlaender with various contributors, and the magazine Variant Chess published from 1990 (George Jellis) to 2010 (the British Chess Variants Society).
                
                In the context of chess variants, regular (i.e. FIDE) chess is commonly referred to as Western chess, international chess, orthodox chess, orthochess, and classic chess.</p>
